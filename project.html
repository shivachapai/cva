      <p>A web designer is a professional who is responsible for designing and creating the visual layout and user interface of websites. They use a variety of design techniques, tools, and programming languages to create web pages that are visually appealing, easy to use, and meet the needs of the website's intended audience. Web designers may work on their own as freelancers, or as part of a team in a design agency or company. They typically collaborate with web developers, who are responsible for the technical implementation of the website, to create a website that meets the client's specifications.</p>
